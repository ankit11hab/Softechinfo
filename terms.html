Number of times you check to the mail server via POP3 / IMAP is restricted to 30. If you exceed this, you will get a failed login error. Connecting to mail server once in 10 min is ideal. Catch all or default mail id must be set to fail. This is to avoid stacking of unnecessary spam mails in the server which finally results in large number of inode creation in the file system. This ultimately results in disk failure.<br><br>

<b>3. System and Network Abuse</b><br><br>

Violations of system or network security are prohibited and may result in criminal and civil liability. Examples of system or network security violations include, without limitation the following: unauthorized access to or use of data, systems or networks, including any attempt to probe, scan or test the vulnerability of a system or network or to breach security or authentication measures without express authorization of the owner of the system or network; interference with service to any user, host or network including, without limitation, mail bombing, flooding, deliberate attempts to overload a system and broadcast attacks; forging of any TCP-IP packet header or any part of the header information in an email or a newsgroup posting.<br><br>

<b>5. Resource Usage</b><br><br>

Email Disk Usage<br>
Stacking large number of emails increases inodes and results in file system corruption. It also hinders various server level processes from functioning at normal load. Hence all mails has to be downloaded from the server then and there. Hosting accounts cannot be used as email storage space. Sites that use higher than this limit has to be upgraded to next available accounts such as corporate or semi dedicated account based on the usage. Failing to upgrade the account will result in suspension or termination of that particular website. Customer accounts such as personal, small biz and accounts under resellers can use disk space upto to 500 MB maximum including emails, website files, database etc.<br>
Disk Space Usage<br>

Customer accounts such as personal, small biz and accounts under resellers can use disk space upto to 500 MB maximum. Only files required for running of the website such as html,php etc can be hosted. Zip archives, downloads, videos, audio files and other software or warez downloads are strictly prohibited. Hosting space cannot be used for data storage or backup dumping. It cannot be used for file sharing, spam software downloads, software key downloads etc. Sites that use higher than this space limit has to be upgraded to next available accounts such as corporate or semi dedicated account based on the usage. Failing to upgrade the account will result in suspension or termination of that particular website.
Any web site that uses a high amount of server resources (such as, but not limited to, CPU time, memory usage, and network resources, mail servers, Ftp servers, Http servers, SQL database servers) reserves the right to suspend that site immediately. This policy is only intended to prevent the misuse of our servers and to avoid interruption in services to other customers. Customers may be offered an option whereby Softech continues hosting the website for an additional fee or upgrade to a higher account. Softech will be the sole arbiter of what is considered to be a high server usage level. Any Web Hosting and E-Commerce account deemed to be adversely affecting server performance or network integrity will be suspended / terminated without prior notice.<br>
The following are the list examples of activities that are not allowed to be hosted in any account;<br>
Scripts running bots, spiders, port scanners, mail blasters
Gaming servers, IRC relays
Peer to Peer sharing, File sharing
Calling include files as a URL rather than as a local file
Running bit torrent applications, trackers
A user may not exceed 20 % of total CPU usage for more than 100 seconds. Usually the reasons for such a spike in usage are poorly written php,cgi, perl or other scripts. If cron jobs are run, it must be scheduled at minimum of 15 min once and not less than that. Running MySql queries for more than 15 seconds is not allowed.
Sites that attract DDOS attacks or automated attacks cannot be hosted in any of the accounts. If found to violate such a term, the account will be immediately suspended / terminated without prior notice. The customer / reseller has to immediately change the name servers out of our servers.<br><br>
 

<b>6. Inodes</b><br><br>

Inode count in a particular account may not exceed 75000. A single inode represents a file in your website ( Includes image, files, emails etc). Frequent creation and deletion of inodes is also prohibited. Most of the cases inode generation is too high due to default or catch all mail ids. It is better to keep them as :fail: which will avoid mails getting stacked up in the server thus increasing inodes creation.<br><br>

<b>7. Back Up</b><br><br>

Softech is in NO way responsible, for the management and backup of all your and your customer data, and all updates, upgrades, emails and patches to any software that customers use in connection with Softech services.
